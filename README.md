Survival analyses of whether partners separated or remained together, examining the influence of partners' reports of satisfaction and conflict in a large sample of couples who recently had a child (sample details reported in Ramey et al., 2015).

I wrote my own functions in R to run discrete-time survival analyses, based on the details given in Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis (Singer & Willett, 2003).
